// How to contribute to the lhcvmm audio test for Buenos Aires Planetarium 5.1 setup

// We use the UGen+Bus infrastructure for mono and stereo tests illustrated in lhcvmm_atk_infrastructure.png file.

// The UGens return a B-Format signal which is routed to the Decoder Bus
// Our Decoder UGen reads from that bus and delivers audio using the selected decoder
// We need to create as much UGens as possible for testing the Planetarium Dome.
// Then, we will organize them in time (a 15 secs piece)

// Start with "Introducing the Ambisonic Toolkit" to catch the ATK paradigm
// We should encode mono and stereo synthetic signals as well as the pseudoinverse mic array since it
// is usually regarded as the method of choice to generate spatially complex synthetic Ambisonic images.
// In combination with the ATK's imaging tools these can then be compositionally controlled as required.

// Then we can write one example for every transform avilable in ATK.
// We will try the dynamic flavours. ATK doc suggests to use FoaTransform instead of individuals UGens

// Transforms

The ATK provides a much wider and comprehensive toolset, including:

rotation: soundfield rotation about an axis
mirror: soundfield reflection across an axis
directivity: soundfield directivity
dominance: adjust directional gain of soundfield
focus: focus on a region of a soundfield
push: push a soundfield in a direction

// Rotation
Definition (1) Positive angles of rotation are anti-clockwise or by convention rotation to the left.
Definition (2) A rotation is defined as a circular movement about a pre- defined axis, normally taken as the Z-axis, this being the same as an anti-clockwise movement in the horizontal plane.

						 pi/-pi


mouse    pi ---- -pi (will rotate from back to back, clockwise, while the cursor goes from left to right)

Example:

    // azimuth -> hard left     = back
    //            centre        = centre
    //            hard right    = back
    azim = MouseX.kr(pi, -pi);

    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // transform
    sig = FoaTransform.ar(sig, 'rotate', azim);
