// How to contribute to the lhcvmm audio test for Buenos Aires Planetarium 5.1 setup

// We use this UGen template for mono and stereo test SynthDefs

    ------------------
    UGen
       Synth
       +
       ATK encoder
       +
       ATK transform
    ------------------

// All the UGens yields a B-Format signal which is routed to the Decoder Bus
// Our Decoder UGen reads from that bus and delivers audio using the selected decoder
// We need to create as much UGens as possible for testing the Planetarium Dome.
// After a while, we should organize them in time (a 15 secs piece)
